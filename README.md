### *Maze Solver*

#### Project Specifications
Note: the framework for the code was given as part of a lab for the CPSC 259 course. 

*Brief description*
Files containing symmetrical mazes of different dimensions made up by integers from 0 to 9 as the possible paths and * as barriers. The program generates all the possible paths, and determines the short and least expensive path.

*Detailed description*
The mazes that the program can solve are given in the form of text files. A file can contain a singular and symmetrical (square) mazes of a certain dimension. The maze is made up of integers from 0 to 9 as the path and * as barriers. The program can determine the number of paths found, the cheapest path, the cost of the cheapest path, and the shortest path.

To begin the process, a maze file is opened. Then, the dimension of the maze is retrieved by determining the length of the first line in the file. Since the mazes are square, this is the only dimension needed. Next, space is allocated for a double pointer with the dimension of the maze, and then the elements are filled with the contents of the maze to create an array-like pointer depiction of the maze file. This allows for the maze to processed.

The array is fed to a function that generates all the possible valid paths. This is done by [depth first search] (https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DFS.html), wherein the program will search as far as possible in one direction or branch of a maze until barriers obstruct all the possible moves except for backtracking. As a path is determined, the visited array cells are marked so that the path is visible in the event of backtracking. This analogous to the purpose of Hansel and Gretelâ€™s trail of breadcrumbs. As a path is traversed, the path - a series of integers from 0 to 9 - is stored in a pointer and is altered with the search process. 

Once an exit is found, space is added to a double pointer containing all the paths generated for that maze and the current path string is copied in. Also, a variable is incremented that counts the number of individual paths found. 
Next, the shortest path is determined by comparing the string lengths of the paths in the paths double pointer. Then, the cheapest path is found by adding the series of integers that make up a given path within all the determined paths. The shortest path and cheapest path do not have to be the same path, since the integer path numbers vary, which is why both functions are necessary.
